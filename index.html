<p2 class="paragraph"> My name is Raj Singh Parhaar.
I was born in a town called Shepparton 2 hours north of Melbourne. Both my parents were Punjabi immigrants and I speak fluent Punjabi. I currently work at an IT Service Desk company for internal ATO employees and have been at this job for about a year.
I am currently studying Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University; my student number being S3965578 and email being S3965578@student.rmit.edu.au.
I have a dog named Lugia (pictured right).
I have a keen interest in history and my hobbies including playing video games, creating boardgames, pastel art and being addicted to nicotine.
I also used to be really into Magic the Gathering, a tabletop card game and I came 4th in an Australian competitive Magic event which is a high I’ve been riding ever since.

<p3 class="paragraph"> I’ve always been interested in IT.
Born in 1999 just before being an ‘iPad kid’ but just after having a personal computer in your house and being a sheltered kid influenced me into becoming chronically online.
I played Gameboy when I was 5 and PC games using dial up internet which required me to at least get accustomed to using technology at a young age and ever since most IT skills have come intuitively to me.
I remember in grade 6 I got an award for IT at my graduation out of my cohort in primary school and since I’ve kept in tune with IT.
As time went on and I learned more about IT and gained a conscious about human morality, the future of IT started to scare me, and I veered away from more IT related work sticking to the humanities.
However, after bouncing around after school with a few different degrees,
I got an IT job which came very naturally to me and I decided learning more about IT was written for me and seeing as how easy my current IT job is I fantasize about making lots of money from an IT job in the future.
I came to RMIT University as its close to where I live in Melbourne. I expect to learn about coding languages and more in depth about server relationships during m degree to help me easily understand harder IT work in the future.

<p4 class="paragraph"> <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/57993690?type=promoted#sol=92e1bfedae80a466ebd5b70bd390cc3c4dfbbccf" target="_blank"> Chief Information Officer </a> <img id=ideal_job src=Ideal_Job.JPG><br><br>
This is something like my ideal job.
This job encompasses all part of the IT management process including knowing new and developing IT that can fulfill roles at the company, strategy and development of new technologies, knowledge about customer usability, security concerns,
performance and regulations of technologies, influencing the direction of the technology at the company. It also pays a stupid amount of money.
Obviously, I am nowhere near this type of role yet, only being a level 1 IT support role for the past 12 months, but this is somewhere I could imagine myself going with enough hustle. IT would involve slowly moving up IT roles in an institution through collaboration
skills and IT knowledge. Currently I have good collaboration skills through my previous employment positions but lack the overall IT knowledge and many of the skills that roles that are above me require. My plan on how I would obtain the skills
and knowledge necessary would be to find new employment after my IT degree in either L2 or L3 IT positions where I could make the necessary connections and learn the necessary knowledge to continue up this path.
Finding flaws in current systems and thinking about logical innovations for my institution would show my prowess for innovation and help me down the path of overall strategy officer.

The results of these tests are not surprising.
I have done tests like these before with similar results.
I know myself well and factor my personality type when situating myself in group environments.
I am often the one to encourage others to present their ideas and to open others up in the group.
I am good at making democratic decisions in groups taking in everyone’s ideas and can usually create roles for each person in the group.
I do often lack my own self control but the need to impress the others in my group helps drive me to do my part of the group work and asking others in the group how they are going helps keep everyone on track with the project.
When creating a team, I am allured to having lots of diverse people and ideas in the group to make sure everyone’s voice is impactful in creating an identity of our project.
Often my group projects create creative and diverse ideas, if not missing a bit of meat on the actual workings.
If I can find hard workers who are less willing to have to think about the project’s grand design but are more willing to create great work in their role hopefully, we can create a great project.

<h6 class="heading" id="Project_idea"> Project Idea
<a href=#top class=link_top>Back to top ^</a></h6>
<p6 class="paragraph">
Overview and motivation -<br>
I own a lot of Magic the Gathering card. (See; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering" target="_blank">Magic the Gathering</a> on wikipedia) At least 20,000, probably more and while I am an avid collector, I am horrendous at organisation.
It would most likely be my deepest flaw.
I have cards all over the place. Some in random boxes in my room, some in random folders in the lounge room, some all over the floor!
This creates an issue when trying to keep track of rare and expensive cards, finding card I already own for creating decks or just having some stability in a part of my life I am passionate about.
This problem isn’t unique to me, many of my friends also have these issues.<br><br>
My project idea is to create an organisational app.
This would include labelling folders with locations in the house and the cards they contain. For example,
I could have a shelf with labelled boxes that correspond to folders on the app, and I could search for a card in the app, and it would tell me exactly where that card is located in my house.
While my house life is messy my computer is squeaky clean with files and folders in their correct places.
If I could integrate my PC organisation and apply it to my real life it would be a massive relief and give me monetary value with card organisation.
This app could start on my desktop and eventually be transferred to my phone.<br><br>

It would also include details about the card such as trending price of the cards online.
I could sort my cards in a specific folder or overall collection into highest price or according to other specifications allowing me to see what cards I could sell right now or even how much the price has changed over the last few months.<br>
<br><br>Description – <br>
The concept is simple.
An interface to first write in a card name (eventually it could even include an image interface so hovering over the card with your phone camera could automatically enter the card.
This is already a feature with other Magic the Gathering apps such as the Card Kingdom app). The card would then be placed in a queue where I can assign it to a folder on the app.
This folder would correspond to a real-world folder/box/storage location.
There could be subfolders in the folder pertaining to the location within the storage location itself as well (such as Row 4, red section in Box 3 Bedroom, etc).
The card would have any relevant categorical information assigned to it and it would also include its trending price online. It would stay in the folder until I assign it out of the folder.
At any time, I could search for a card name in my collection and find out which folder it is in as well. It’s as simple as that.<br><br>
Other features that could be included.
<br><br>-	A deck builder. This would be an interface where you could create or import a deck with however many cards. The app will then tell you if you have any of the cards required for the deck and which folders the cards are located.
<br><br>-	Sort by category or price for the collection or individual folders. If I keep rare or expensive cards in a specific folder, I can see their price at this time (tending online).
<br><br>-	Price trends built in. I could click on a card and see its price 6 months ago, a year ago and now, etc. This could even just easily be a link to a website which already does this such as MTG Goldfish.
<br><br>-	Links to buy lists online for cards I don’t currently own. If I create a deck and it is a missing card, I could click on those cards and there could be links to eBay listings or store listings.
<br><br>-	Cloud storage of my collection for ease of access from my PC, phone, someone else’s phone with accounts to keep track of this information rather than local storage alone.
<br><br>-	‘Draft Chaff’ options to store cards in places without needed to input individual cards, only needing the number of cards placed in a folder. Many cards are worthless and always will be and as such you could add a certain number of cards labelled as ‘draft chaff’ in a folder or only add them according to their colour.
<br><br>
Tools and Technology - <br><br>
Skills required - <br><br>
Outcome - <br>
If the project is successful a commercial launch would be a great idea.
While these types of apps are available on the market many have confusing and overcomplicated UIs or/and are premium subscriptions.
This app would be minimalist and free for use to anyone. If money is needed for cloud storage that could be premium option but the base idea for organising and managing your collection and tracking price data would be free.
 Or if revenue is needed the use of un-intrusive ads (with the option to remove them with a onetime payment) could suffice.
This would be a huge motivator and step in solving my organisational issues with Magic the Gathering as being able to search a card on my phone and being told exactly where I have put it beats hours of trying to find a card manually, eventually giving up and just buying a new copy of the card.
